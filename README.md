# CameraAppReactNative

*React Native sample app with native camera bridging - Kotlin*

This application integrates Android's CameraX API for capturing images. The app includes features such as toggling the flash mode, capturing images, and displaying them within the app. Captured images are saved to the app's internal storage and are accessible only within the app.


The app allows the user to:
- Open the device's camera.
- Toggle the flash mode (on/off).
- Capture a photograph and display it in the app with its internal storage image path.

Features:
- Native Android Camera X integration using Kotlin.
- Flash mode toggle.
- Display captured images within the React Native app.

Notes:

- This implementation supports *Android* only.
- Ensure that your device has a camera and the necessary permissions are granted.
